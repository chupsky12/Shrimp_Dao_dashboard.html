Governance & Ownership
• Shrimp DAO
– NFT holders can vote on future drop themes, fee splits, grant allocations.
• On-Chain Proposals
– Use Anoma intents to submit & execute DAO proposals (e.g. “mint additional rare Shrimp”).
• Transparent Roadmap
– Public Trello/GitHub board with milestones: tech, drops, community events.

Marketing & Partnerships
• NFT Marketplaces & Indexers
– Integrate with cross-chain NFT aggregators (e.g. Mystiko, NFTrade).
• Cross-Chain Showcases
– Pop-ups in metaverses (Spatial, Decentraland) featuring Shrimp galleries.
• Influencer Collabs
– Web3 artists, YouTubers & Twitch streamers minting “live” on Anoma.

Metrics & Feedback Loops
• KPIs
– Shrimp minted per week
– Daily active minters/traders
– Unique holders & cross-chain transfers
– DAO proposal turnout
• Quarterly Retros
– Survey community for feature requests
– Adjust roadmap every 3 months based on on-chain data & feedbackProtocol & Scalability
– Goal: Handle thousands of intents per second, with minimal fees.
– Key initiatives:
• Pilot zk-rollup and optimistic rollup designs to batch intents off-chain.
• Prototype sharding or intent channels so solver nodes can process in parallel.

Privacy & Security
– Goal: Keep user data and transaction details confidential by default.
– Key initiatives:
• Integrate next-gen zk-proof systems (Halo2, Spartan) for lightning-fast proofs.
• Offer selective-disclosure intents so apps only see exactly what they need.
• Explore MPC and threshold-signature wallets for safer key management.

Cross-Chain Interoperability
– Goal: Let any asset or intent flow freely between Anoma and other chains.
– Key initiatives:
• Build trust-minimized IBC bridges to EVM and Cosmos chains.
• Standardize a universal intent schema so any rollup or chain can match your intent.

Developer Experience
– Goal: Make building on Anoma as frictionless as possible.
– Key initiatives:
• Ship rock-solid JS/TS, Python and Rust SDKs with built-in intent debugging.
• Offer a local “ganache-style” dev cluster CLI that visually logs every intent.
• Publish 5-minute quickstarts and end-to-end video tutorials for common flows.

UX & Wallet Integrations
– Goal: Let end-users interact with intents in their favorite wallets and UIs.
– Key initiatives:
• Deliver an “intent-aware” browser/mobile wallet plugin that auto-optimizes fees.
• Provide plug-and-play React/Vue components for minting, swapping, and cross-chain transfers.

Governance & On-Chain Ops
– Goal: Empower the community to steer protocol development transparently.
– Key initiatives:
• Roll out modular on-chain governance modules: fee tuning, grants, upgrades.
• Enable DAO referenda via intent submissions and on-chain execution.
• Maintain a public dashboard for core metrics (intents resolved, fees burned, solver performance).

Ecosystem & Community
– Goal: Forge a vibrant network of builders, artists, solvers and end-users.
– Key initiatives:
• Seed a quarterly grant and bounty program for tooling, marketplaces and analytics.
• Host global hackathons and local meetups under the Anoma banner.
• Launch an ambassador program to champion Anoma in major Web3 hubs.

Analytics & Insights
– Goal: Give everyone the data they need to track network health and usage.
– Key initiatives:
• Build an Intent Explorer with filters by type (swap, payment, NFT) and solver stats.
• Offer webhooks and APIs to alert apps about intent status changes or fee spikes.
• Publish monthly “state of the network” reports highlighting growth, volume and performance trends.
